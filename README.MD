Meet an application on 3000 port.

#This application is front-end only tool. Actually this is simple scheduler. So, you can add an event, edit already added or remove it.
 To create the event click on day you want to add in.
 An opened popup is exactly to fill data of this event. Click Save to add it into scheduler or Cancel if you have reasons.
 If you click on already existed event, popup with data of this event will be opened. You can change it and save (save, see above) or
 just see a description and other details and close by Cancel with no changes. Or you can find a button Delete, push it 
 and the event will be deleted after your confirmation.
 
 Buttons 'prev week', 'next week' allow you slide the scheduler by week.
